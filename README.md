# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to control the snake, eat the apples, and grow in length without hitting the walls or yourself.

## Features
- Snake grows in length every time it eats an apple.
- Speed increases as the score increases.
- Game Over screen with a gradient effect.
- Responsive keyboard controls (WASD or Arrow Keys).
- Simple and clean design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the basic structure of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling the canvas and other elements.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, rendering the snake, handling movement, and detecting collisions.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** keys to control the snake.
   - `W` or `Arrow Up`: Move up
   - `S` or `Arrow Down`: Move down
   - `A` or `Arrow Left`: Move left
   - `D` or `Arrow Right`: Move right
3. Eat the apples (red squares) to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end.

## Game Mechanics

### Snake
- The snake starts at a fixed position and can be moved using the keyboard.
- Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows in length and the score is increased.
- The snakeâ€™s speed increases after reaching a score of 5 and 10.

### Apples
- Apples appear at random locations on the canvas.
- When the snake eats an apple, its length increases, and the apple reappears at a new random position.

### Game Over
- The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or itself.
- When the game ends, "Game Over" is displayed with a gradient text effect.

## Controls
- **W** or **Arrow Up**: Move up
- **S** or **Arrow Down**: Move down
- **A** or **Arrow Left**: Move left
- **D** or **Arrow Right**: Move right



## Customization

- You can change the snake's speed by adjusting the `speed` variable in `index.js`.
- Customize the canvas and game appearance by modifying the CSS in `style.css`.
